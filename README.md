# Lens-Light-2025
 Lens & Light 2025 is a specialized web platform designed to streamline the participant registration process for the annual photography contest at Shri Ramswaroop Memorial University (SRMU).

The project transitions the contest from traditional manual entries to a digital-first approach. By providing a centralized hub for rules, themes, and submissions, the platform aims to increase student participation and ensure a seamless administrative workflow. The visual identity of the platform is deeply rooted in its core theme: "Nature Through the Lens."
